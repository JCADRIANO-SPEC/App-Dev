## Why I Love It
- **Action Sequence**: John Wick is renowned for its intense and stylishly choreographed fight scenes, including hand-to-hand combat, gun-fu (a blend of martial arts and firearms combat), and expertly executed stunts.
- **A story of revenge**: The movie's plot revolves around a simple yet powerful motivation: revenge. After the loss of his beloved dog (a final gift from his late wife), John Wick embarks on a relentless quest for vengeance, making the story emotionally gripping and relatable.
- **Emotional Depth**: Beyond the action, John Wick is driven by a personal story of grief and loss. His love for his late wife and the emotional weight of losing his dog add a deeper layer to the character, making the audience empathize with his actions.
